print("Hello, World!") 

# TODO: Print is a function that prints the specified message to the screen. The string should be written in double quotes. But you can also use single quotes and triple quotes.
#* For example:
print('Hello, World!')
print("""Hello, World!""")
#* The output will be the same in all three cases.

# TODO: You can also use the + operator to concatenate two strings.
#* For example:
print("Hello " + "World!")
#* The output will be HelloWorld!

# TODO: You can also use the * operator to repeat a string.
#* For example:
print("Hello " * 3)
#* The output will be HelloHelloHello

# TODO: You can also use the sep parameter to separate the strings.
#* For example:
print("Hello", "World!", sep=" ")

# TODO: You can also use the end parameter to specify the end character.
#* For example:
print("Hello", end=" ")
print("World!") # this is not usually done in Python

# TODO: You can print numbers without quotes.
#* For example:
print(42)

#! Now, Remember that python is case-sensitive. So, print("Hello") and Print("Hello") are different. 
# Print("Hello") # This will give an error.

#? As i said we can write numbers without string.
#? We can also do calculations.
#* For example:
print(2 + 2) # This will give 4.
print(2 - 2) # This will give 0.
print(2 * 2) # This will give 4.
print(2 / 2) # This will give 1.

#! It will not give output as you write it. It will give the output of the calculation. For that you have to write it in double quotes.
#* For example:
print("2 + 2") # This will give 2 + 2.

#! We are done.

#* Exercise: Write a program that will print your name and age.
